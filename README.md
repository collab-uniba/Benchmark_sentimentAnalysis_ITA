# Benchmark_sentimentAnalysis_ITA

This repository contains the notebooks useful for carrying out the Sentiment Analysis task on tweets in Italian using two approaches: Lexicon-based and BERT-based.
The objective of this project is to compare the two approaches and benchmark their performance to understand in which contexts they can be best used.

The reference data for this project were obtained through the Twitter API and amount to almost 2k tweets relating to the public administration.
In the data/processed folder there are two files relating to the gold standard, one of the two is deprived of the columns associated with the text of the tweets so that it can also be used in contexts where the diffusion of this type of textual data is limited.
