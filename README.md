# Benchmark_sentimentAnalysis_ITA

This repository contains the notebooks useful for carrying out the Sentiment Analysis task on tweets in Italian using two approaches: Lexicon-based and BERT-based.
The objective of this project is to compare the two approaches and benchmark their performance to understand in which contexts they can be best used.

The reference data for this project were obtained through the Twitter API and amount to almost 2k tweets relating to the public administration.
